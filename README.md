# social-media-csharp
 I made a social media program within c sharp. It was my final project of learning OOP. It includes a way of creating an account, logging in, you being able to create posts, like posts, and view your profile. 
 
 In my OOP-Learnings repository, it shows all evidence of me learning this material of OOP (inheritance, encapsulation, abstraction, etc.)

 # how to run
 * Clone the repository
 * Open with vscode or your preferred IDE/code editor
 * Open the socialmedia folder
 * Open the Menus.cs file
 * In the Menu.cs file, run the program
 * Follow the codes instructions from there to create account/login
